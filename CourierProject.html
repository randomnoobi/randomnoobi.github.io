        <h3>11/23/25 Week 1: Planning</h3>
        <p>This week, I focused on planning the game out. For this game I decided to keep the pixel art style and the 2d platformer gameplay. This game is a fast-paced 2D action-platformer where you play as a frontier courier sprinting through a handcrafted village and the wilderness surrounding it. Gameplay focuses on smooth, momentum-based movement: running, jumping, dashing, vaulting, and chaining movement skills together to deliver packages as efficiently as possible. Each delivery is a short challenge—sometimes a race against time, sometimes a platforming puzzle, sometimes an obstacle run requiring precise jumps and quick reactions. NPCs scattered throughout the village give tasks that expand traversal routes, unlock new areas, and introduce unique modifiers like fragile packages, oversized crates, stealth routes, or nighttime deliveries. The world grows more interconnected as you progress: new shortcuts open, buildings unlock, and the village becomes a movement playground where mastery of your abilities turns every delivery into a fluid speedrun.</p>
