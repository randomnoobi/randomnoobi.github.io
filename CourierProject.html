        <h3>11/23/25 Week 1: Planning</h3>
        <p>This week, I mainly focused on figuring out the overall direction of the game. I decided to stick with a pixel-art aesthetic and build it as a 2D platformer, but with a stronger emphasis on fast, fluid movement than anything I’ve made before. The idea I’m settling into is a game where you play as a courier running deliveries through a small frontier village and the surrounding wilderness. As I planned things out, I realized I want the core gameplay to feel really momentum-based—lots of running, jumping, and dashing that all chain smoothly together. I also sketched out how deliveries will work: some will be timed challenges, others will be more puzzle-like, and a few will force the player to navigate tricky terrain or hazards. I wrote down ideas for NPCs around the village that can give different delivery tasks, open shortcuts, or unlock new areas. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of the world slowly becoming a movement playground as you progress. Overall, most of this week was about refining the concept and getting a clearer picture of what the gameplay loop will look like as I start building it.</p>

        <h3>12/10/25 Week 2: Art</h3>
        <p>This week I also worked on the player’s animations, which helped define how the character feels in motion. I created a full set of core movement animations: idle, run, jump, and dash. The idle animation keeps the character grounded with a small breathing motion so they don’t feel static. The run animation is snappy and has a clear forward lean, which sells the sense of speed and momentum I want for the game. For the jump animation, I drew a strong upward pose that reads immediately on screen, making it obvious when the player leaves the ground. And finally, the dash animation exaggerates the motion with a stretched silhouette so the burst of speed feels impactful. Having these animations finished makes it much easier to visualize how the character will move through the world, and it’s already helping me fine-tune the game’s feel as I connect the art to the movement system.</p>
